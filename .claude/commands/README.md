# Commands - Namespace Organization

This collection of commands is organized into logical namespaces to help you quickly find the right tool for your task.

## Command Namespaces

## Instructions

To use any specific command, navigate to the appropriate namespace directory and select the command you need.

## Usage

Commands follow the namespace pattern: `/<namespace>:<command>`

## Quick Start

## Command Availability

Commands are loaded from:
- **Project-level**: `.claude/commands/` (this directory)
- **User-level**: `~/.claude/commands/` (your personal commands)

Project-level commands take precedence when there are naming conflicts.
